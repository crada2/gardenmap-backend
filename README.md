Garden Maps 🌳
============

***

## Introduction 🚜

The "GardenMaps" project is a web application that aims to link families and agriculture enthusiasts, through activities that promote services such as rent or sale of natural products.

## Objectives of the practice 🌱🌿

1.- Users will be able to locate the orchards closest to their home, enjoy open-air events, and keep up to date with their activities and services.

2.- Users will be able to create the events, services or activities that they promote in their gardens or green areas.

3.- Users can register, log in or log out.

4.- Users can delete completed services or activities.
